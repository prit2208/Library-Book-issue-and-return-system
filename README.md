# Library-Book-issue-and-return-system
 The "Library Book Issue and Return System" is a Java project that aims to manage the borrowing and returning of books in a library. The project utilizes a database (MySQL) to store information about the books, including their availability status.

Before proceeding with the code, please ensure that you have the MySQL JDBC driver added to your project's classpath. You can download it from the official MySQL website.

LibraryBook.java:
LibraryDatabase.java:

In this code, we have two classes: LibraryBook represents the book entity with its properties, and LibraryDatabase provides methods to issue and return books from the library.

The LibraryDatabase class utilizes the MySQL JDBC driver to establish a connection with the database (library_db), and the issueBook and returnBook methods update the book's availability status based on the provided book ID.

To execute the code, make sure to replace the DB_URL, DB_USER, and DB_PASSWORD variables with your MySQL database connection details. You'll also need to set up the books table in the library_db database, which should contain columns for book_id, book_title, and is_available.

Finally, running the main method in the LibraryDatabase class will test the functionality by issuing and returning a book with the given book ID.

Remember to have the MySQL server (such as XAMPP or WAMPP) running before executing the code.

Feel free to modify the code to fit your specific requirements, such as adding more database operations or additional functionality.
